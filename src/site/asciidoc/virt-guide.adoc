= Virtualization Guide

== Introduction

This guide describes how to generate a virtual machine (VM) or container image that provides 
a complete TEAMengine installation along with the latest OGC conformance test suites. The 
required software components are shown in the following figure.

https://www.packer.io/[Packer] is an open-source infrastructure definition tool used 
to create images for a variety of dynamic infrastructure platforms. It includes builders 
for many virtual environments, such as:

* VirtualBox
* Amazon EC2
* VMware vSphere
* Google Compute Engine
* Docker (container)

.Virtual machines vs. containers
**********
A container is not a full-blown virtual machine--it doesn't require a hypervisor and runs in 
an isolated environment provided by a single host operating system. Since the OS kernel is 
shared, a container generally has less overhead than a virtual machine. Container technologies 
such as Docker, Warden, and Rocket offer a way to package and distribute a service or an 
application along with its dependencies.
**********

The build process is driven by a template: a configuration file (in JSON format) that defines 
how a machine image is created and automatically provisioned.

To install Packer, simply download the appropriate https://www.packer.io/downloads.html[binary package] 
for your environment and unpack the archive into a suitable directory; then set the following 
user environment variables:

PACKER_HOME:: The directory where packer is installed.
PACKER_CACHE_DIR:: The location of the packer cache (for downloaded resources).

Update the PATH environment variable to include PACKER_HOME.

== VirtualBox

=== Overview

https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] is a freely available virtualization product 
that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac hosts. It supports a wide variety of guest operating 
systems and is very useful in creating development or test environments. The Packer 
template will create a complete, ready-to-run teamengine installation that contains
the desired set of OGC test suites. The output is an "appliance" (in the standard http://www.dmtf.org/standards/ovf[OVF format]) 
that can be imported into VirtualBox.

=== Install VirtualBox

To install VirtualBox, download a suitable https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[installation package] for 
your host environment; see the user manual for https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html[installation instructions].
When installation is complete, set the following user environment variable:

VBOX_USER_HOME:: The location where virtual machines will be created.

=== Creating and importing the image

The Packer template makes use of several supporting shell scripts and files (see Note 1). In the 
'files' subdirectory is a CSV file (ets-releases.csv) that contains a list of OGC test suite releases; 
each line has two fields: a Git repository URL, and a tag name indicating the release version. The 
test suites listed in this file will be added to the TEAM-engine instance. If a test suite is not 
wanted, just comment it out by inserting a number sign (or hash character, #) at the beginning of 
the appropriate line.

[NOTE]
==========
The template file (teamengine-centos72.json) can be found in the src/main/config/packer/ directory in the 
teamengine source tree, or wherever the Packer assembly was unpacked. To create the packer assembly, run 
this Maven command at the root of the teamengine source tree: `mvn assembly:single`.
==========

The template defines several user variables that can be overridden from the command line or a file; 
see https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html). These are listed in the table below, 
along with their default values.

.Template variables
[cols="1,1,3"]
|==========
|Variable |Default value |Description 

|te_version |"4.7" |The desired version of the TEAMengine web application http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22teamengine-web%22[available at Maven Central].
|ets_resources_release |"" |The desired https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-resources/releases[ets-resources release version];
this project aggregates all test suite dependencies. If not specified, the latest snapshot (tip of the master branch) will be used.
|use_oracle_jdk |"false" |Whether or not to use the Oracle JDK (which is subject to a 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html[license agreement]). 
If not, OpenJDK will be used.
|==========

To create the virtual appliance, simply change to the directory containing the Packer template and 
execute this command in a shell console:

-----
packer build teamengine-centos72.json
-----

The appliance will be created in the output-centos72-virtualbox subdirectory. The base operating 
system is https://www.centos.org/[CentOS] 7.2 (more specifically, the minimal distribution intended 
for "headless" operation). To run it, start VirtualBox and perform the following steps:

. Choose *File > Import Appliance...* and select the *.ovf file 
. When the import is completed, select the newly created virtual machine and press "Start" 
. When the boot sequence finishes, login using an SSH client to localhost:2222--or use the 
VirtualBox terminal--with the teamengine user credentials (see Note 2) 
. To start or stop Tomcat, execute this command:  `sudo systemctl start|stop tomcat-jsvc`
. The main teamengine web app is available at \http://localhost:8888/teamengine (see Note 3)

[NOTE]
==========
The user credentials are specified in the Packer template (`ssh_name`, `ssh_pass`). This is a 
normal user account with 'sudo' privileges.

[NOTE]
==========
The VM runs on a private internal network using the default networking mode: network address 
translation (NAT); this prevents all direct inbound connections, but not outbound connections. 
Some port forwarding rules are created in order to allow remote access to the SSH server (via 
localhost:2222) and the Tomcat web container (via localhost:8888).
